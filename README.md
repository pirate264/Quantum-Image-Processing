🧠 Quantum Image Processing
📌 Overview

Quantum Image Processing (QIP) is an emerging field that integrates quantum computing with digital image processing to represent and analyze images using quantum principles such as superposition and quantum parallelism. This project focuses on encoding grayscale images using NEQR (Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation) and performing quantum edge detection using quantum circuits simulated with Qiskit.
